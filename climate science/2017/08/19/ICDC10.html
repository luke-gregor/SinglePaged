<p>I recently attended the 10th International Carbon Dioxide Conference (ICDC) in Interlaken, Switzerland, where I presented a poster. The conference brings together ocean, atmosphere, terrestrial and political scientists to talk about how anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is impacting the natural cycles. One of the great things about this conference is that we learn from these different fields.</p>

<p>The talks on climate change and policy were  interesting as they summarised the motivation for a lot of the work at the conference. In particular a presentation by <a href="http://www.cicero.uio.no/en/employee/30/glen-peters" title="">Glen Peters from CICERO</a>. Here are some quotes from his presentation:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>Current emission pledges to the Paris Agreement appear insufficient to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>Explosive and policy-driven growth in wind and solar has contributed to the global emissions slowdown, but has been less important than economic factors and energy efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This highlights the comlexity of the climate change problem, showing that ultimately policy will be needed to push companies and consumers in the right direction ( &lt; 2°C). This is also the reason that the IPCC, the International Panel for Climate Change (UN) has intrudced the new Shared Socioeconomic Scenarios (SSPs), which was presented by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nico_Bauer" title="">Nico Bauer</a>. There are currently five SSP naritives for the next assesment report (<a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959378016300681" title="">Riahi et al., 2017)</a>:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Sustainability: </b> The world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. </li>
    <li><b>Middle of the road: </b>The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. </li>
    <li><b>Regional rivalry:</b> A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues.</li>
    <li><b>Inequality: </b>Highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries.</li>
    <li><b>Fossil-fueled Development: </b>This world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. </li>
