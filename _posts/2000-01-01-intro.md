I am Luke Gregor, a Cape Town based oceanographer.  
<br><br>
I look at how climate change is affecting the ocean. More specifically, how natural carbon dioxide fluxes are affected by human driven climate change. 
<br><br>
I recently completed my PhD thesis and I am currently a research intern at the Southern Ocean Carbon-Climate Observatory based at theCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).
